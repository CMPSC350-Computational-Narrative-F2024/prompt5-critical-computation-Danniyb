# Chain of Thought Analysis

1. Title Analysis: The story titled "How the Whale Got His Throat" is indicative of a narrative that explains a characteristic of a whale, specifically concerning its throat. The title suggests a fable or a folktale which usually seeks to explain natural phenomena through anthropomorphized characters, here, a whale.

2. Narrative Style: The story is written in a conversational tone, addressing an audience referred to as "O my Best Beloved." This suggests an intimate and affectionate relationship between the narrator and the listener, possibly a parent-child dynamic, which is common in storytelling traditions.

3. Characterization: The Whale is portrayed as a large, powerful creature with an insatiable appetite, while the 'Stute Fish, small in size, is revealed to be cunning, persuasive, and knowledgeable. The mariner is described as a person of "infinite-resource-and-sagacity," suggesting a character of great wit and adaptability. The repeated use of this phrase emphasizes the mariner's cleverness, which ultimately saves him.

4. Repetition: The author uses repetition for comic effect and to emphasize certain elements. For instance, the phrase "you must not forget the suspenders" is frequently repeated, which later ties into the narrative when the suspenders become crucial for the mariner's escape from the whale's belly.

5. Symbolism: The Whale can be seen as a symbol of raw and uninhibited power, while the mariner embodies wisdom and resourcefulness. The 'Stute Fish can be seen as a mediator or a trickster figure, manipulating both the Whale and the mariner to his advantage.

6. Motifs: The story uses the motif of journey, where the Whale travels to various locations following the 'Stute Fish's guidance. The motif of transformation is also present, as the Whale undergoes a change in its eating habits due to the mariner's intervention.

7. Narrative Structure: The story follows a linear structure, starting with the Whale's original state, moving through the mariner's journey inside the whale, and concluding with the change in the whale's eating habits. 

8. Ending Analysis: The story concludes with the whale's transformation, the 'Stute Fish's fear of retribution, and the mariner's return home, tying all narrative threads together. The moral seems to be that wit and resourcefulness can overcome brute power, and that there are consequences to unchecked gluttony.

9. Themes: The story explores themes of power, cunning, transformation, and consequences. The power dynamics shift throughout the story, from the Whale's dominance to the mariner's clever retaliation. The transformation of the Whale's eating habits represents the consequences of his initial gluttony.

10. Contextual Analysis: Given that Rudyard Kipling is known for his works during the British imperialism period, one could interpret the story as a critique of imperial power (the Whale), which despite its size and strength, is outwitted by a common mariner (representing the colonized or local wisdom). This interpretation, however, would require broader textual and historical evidence.
